# LLM for Cyber-Physical Systems featuring an Agent Controller

This project presents the code and tests results performed for the submission of the paper : _Integration of 
Large Language Models into Control Systems for Shared Appliances_. The study aims at providing a solution to 
pilot various appliances with LLMs involved in the control loop. As a case study, we focused on the control of
a heating system shared among multiple users.

Two case studies are presented : 

1. the first focuses on the simulation of a heating system controlled by three personas,
2. the second focuses on mediation of the interaction user(s) and the heating system using ChatGPT.
